# Functional Programming

There's a lot of cool things about the functional programming "paradigm." I'm very grateful that it's taught at school through OCaml (in 3110). Keeping in line with my introduction, these are probably my favorite features about functional programming.

- Functions are first class - this allows functions to be passed around and allows for cool things like partial application and higher-order functions
- Pattern matching - much safer way of handling multiple cases, preventing duplicate and missing matches
- Immutability - makes programs easier to reason about
- Map/fold - super powerful and fast way of applying functions over iterable/traversable data
- Monads - a "type" that comes with 2 defined functions (monad laws): wrapping data and creating a new monad; mainly cool in the context of possibly undefined values (`Maybe` monad)
