# Riptide

Vance Joy - Riptide

To me this song tells a story of how some things don't work out. I remember attending summer camp: a guy (my roommate) liked a girl, but she didn't like him back. But, they sang this song together at the end of camp performance. So, it's like a sweet yet sad song for me.
