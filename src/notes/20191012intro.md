# Intro

I figured I should write some notes to express what's on my mind. I don't really know how this format will evolve, but I guess this is like blogging.

I got really lucky and got an on-campus interview with Apple this past career fair. I didn't get the position, but the interviewer did give me some tips about remembering what I learn. He said when I learn something, I should try to remember the top 5 things about it, so that I can concisely explain it to others.

But also, I'm a bad writer, so don't expect much.
