    <h1>A little bit about me.</h1>
    <p>I'm a student at Cornell studying computer science and statistics.</p>
    <p>Outside of classes, I make Android apps and web apps.</p>
    <p>
      For fun, I enjoy taking photos, doodling, designing, playing basketball,
      browsing Reddit, and just reading random stuff (mostly online).
